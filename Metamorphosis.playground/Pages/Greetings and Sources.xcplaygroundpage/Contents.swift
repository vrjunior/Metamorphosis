 # Beyond the Code

 This is a metaphor about how important is to pass over difficult moments, just like a caterpillar turn into a butterfly. And how we close our eyes to goodness, sometimes only seeing the bad of life.
 I had this experience recently and this was my inspiration to create this little narrative as a playground.

 And I think that the ability to create a experience is really importat for all products, specially because the entire software industry sells experiences, not only products.
